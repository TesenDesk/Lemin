**	For normal operation, we expect all three parameters to exist. This is the

**
**	The function frees the memory of the node of the linked list, changes the
** value of a pointer to it to a pointer to zero and, if necessary, changes the
** value to the head. It should distinguish three cases: the first - a coherent
** list is represented by a single element, then you need to delete the entire
** list; the second - the element to be deleted is at the beginning; and all
** other cases (one of the private instances of which is the node at the end of
** the list, but all of them are treated the same).
**
**	The return value is empty.
